## Description

Shipping classes are used to group products with similar shipping needs. Products assigned to a shipping class inherit its settings and default shipping cost. This functionality comes with WooCommerce by default. This plugin allows you to attach a seperate and unrelated fee to your shipping classes. It adds an additonal "Fee" field to the shipping class table (found under WooComerce Settings -> Shipping -> Shipping Classes). This Fee is displayed along side the shipping class description on the cart and checkout pages.
